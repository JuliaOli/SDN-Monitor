The internet has led to the creation of a digital society, where (almost) everything is connected and is accessible from anywhere. But traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this situation, separating the network’s control logic from the underlying routers and switches and introducing the ability to program the network.
Network Analytics (NA) comes to joint hands with Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN) and facilitate the adoption of AI techniques in the context of network operation and control.[[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6994333)
